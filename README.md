# 🐝 BumbleBee Project
The BumbleBee project consists of two parts: the frontend (bumblebee-app-cli) and the backend (bumblebee-app-srv). Each part has its own README file with instructions on how to run them.

For the best experience, it's recommended to run both together, but they can also be run separately.
